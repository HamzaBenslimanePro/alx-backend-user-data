This Python function, `get_logger`, is designed to create and configure a logger specifically for handling user data. This logger will ensure that sensitive information (PIIâ€”Personally Identifiable Information) in the logs is redacted before being output. Let's break down the function step by step:

### 1. **Importing Required Modules**

Before you use this function, you need to have the `logging` module imported, which is a standard Python module for logging.

### 2. **Function Overview**
```python
def get_logger() -> logging.Logger:
    """Creates a new logger for user data."""
```
- **`get_logger`**: This function returns a `logging.Logger` instance, which is a configured logger tailored for user data.
- **Return Type**: The function returns a `logging.Logger` object, indicated by the return type hint `-> logging.Logger`.

### 3. **Creating a Logger**
```python
logger = logging.getLogger("user_data")
```
- **`logging.getLogger("user_data")`**: This line retrieves or creates a logger named `"user_data"`. Loggers are named entities in Python's logging system, and using a specific name allows you to configure loggers for different parts of your application separately.

### 4. **Creating a StreamHandler**
```python
stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
```
- **`logging.StreamHandler()`**: This creates a `StreamHandler` instance, which sends logging output to streams like `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`. By default, it sends the output to `sys.stderr`.

### 5. **Setting a Formatter**
```python
stream_handler.setFormatter(RedactingFormatter(PII_FIELDS))
```
- **`RedactingFormatter(PII_FIELDS)`**: `RedactingFormatter` is a custom formatter (presumably defined elsewhere in your code) that takes `PII_FIELDS` as an argument. It is responsible for formatting log messages and redacting sensitive information based on the fields specified in `PII_FIELDS`.
- **`setFormatter`**: This method sets the formatter for the `StreamHandler`, ensuring that every log message processed by this handler will be formatted (and redacted) according to the rules defined in `RedactingFormatter`.

### 6. **Setting the Log Level**
```python
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```
- **`setLevel(logging.INFO)`**: This sets the logging level to `INFO`. The logger will process and output messages at the `INFO` level and higher (e.g., `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`), but it will ignore lower-level messages like `DEBUG`.

### 7. **Disabling Propagation**
```python
logger.propagate = False
```
- **`logger.propagate = False`**: By setting `propagate` to `False`, you prevent log messages from being passed to higher-level loggers in the logging hierarchy. This is useful if you want the messages logged by `"user_data"` to only appear in the configured stream handler and not be duplicated in other handlers.

### 8. **Adding the Handler to the Logger**
```python
logger.addHandler(stream_handler)
```
- **`addHandler(stream_handler)`**: This attaches the `StreamHandler` to the logger. Now, the logger will send its output through this handler, which means it will be formatted and redacted before being displayed.

### 9. **Returning the Logger**
```python
return logger
```
- Finally, the function returns the configured `logger` instance.

### Example Usage

Once you have the `get_logger` function defined, you can use the logger in your application like this:

```python
logger = get_logger()
logger.info("User logged in with email=johndoe@example.com and password=secret")
```

If the `RedactingFormatter` works correctly, the output would be something like:

```
User logged in with email=[REDACTED] and password=[REDACTED]
```

This ensures that any sensitive information in the logs is appropriately redacted before being output to the console or any other configured log destination.
